# golang-basic
Go is a programming language designed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is an open-source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software solutions. Go is a statically typed and compiled programming language. Statically typed means that variable types are explicitly declared and thus are determined at compile time. Whereas, by compiled language we mean a language that translates source code to machine code before execution.
